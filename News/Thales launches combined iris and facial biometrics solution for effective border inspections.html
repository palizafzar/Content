    <title>Thales launches combined iris and facial biometrics solution for effective border inspections</title>
</head>
<body>

<p>Thales has introduced a new multimodal biometric module that combines face and retinal biometrics to facilitate the simplification of border and immigration processes for travelers and border authorities.</p>
<p>The pod is a biometric enrollment and authentication solution comprised of a camera and a high-resolution LCD screen, which the company claims accurately recognizes the iris and face biometrics of pre-enrolled travelers from up to 1.5 meters away. Dual biometrics are captured in two seconds to expedite operations and reduce wait times significantly.</p>
<p>The solution can be used independently or integrated with self-service solutions for initial enrollment and subsequent biometric tests.</p>
<p>According to the proclamation, authorities can deploy Thales biometric devices at any kind of border checkpoint. Additionally, Thales asserts that the solution is based on security and privacy by design and facilitates the automation of border authorities' processes.</p>
<p>Youzec Kurp, vice president of Identity and Biometric Solutions at Thales, explains that the combination of biometric patterns and contactless authentication is a highly sought-after solution for addressing security, operational, and convenience issues. "Thales relies on its in-house biometrics, border, and smart travel expertise to design, develop, and deliver top-tier, responsible biometric solutions to meet users' expectations and authorities' requirements."</p>
<p>Thales is a significant global provider of biometric equipment for frontiers, as evidenced by an agreement signed this year to supply terminals to Spain to support the EU Entry-Exit System.</p>
