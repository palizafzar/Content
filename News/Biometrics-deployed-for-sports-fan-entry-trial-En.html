<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Falcons" title="Atlanta Falcons" target="_blank"><u>Atlanta Falcons</u></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Broncos" title="Denver Broncos" target="_blank"><u>Denver Broncos</u></a> of the National Football League are the most recent to announce intentions to implement face biometrics for fan attendance and concessions payments.</p>
<p>Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, home to the Falcons and Atlanta United of Major League Soccer, is planning a trial with between 50 and 100 holders of season tickets in the club-seat section, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports.</p>
<p>During the trial, facial recognition will be used to identify ticket holders and specify how many tickets they possess. It could eventually be used to automate purchases made in restaurants, pubs, and concession stands.</p>
<p>A spokesman of the parent corporation of the two Atlanta clubs, AMB Sports & Entertainment (AMBSE), states that palm print biometrics may also be explored, and that fans will be surveyed to determine the efficacy of the technology. Once it has been determined that stadium biometrics are ready for the big leagues, only then will a timeframe be established for its deployment.</p>
<h2>TendedBar installed in Denver</h2>
<p>TendedBar has been inaugurated at Empower Field at Mile High, home of the Denver Broncos, by concessions operators Aramark to verify guests’ age and identification with facial recognition from Trueface, claims local outlet 9News.</p>
<p>The business also incorporates analytics that allow it to offer previously purchased beverages to fans.</p>
<p>At the stadium, three TendedBar locations are not operational.</p>
<p>Enrolling in TendedBar requires a QR code and driver's license scan, as well as a two-minute mobile process.</p>
<p>Biometric bars are also utilized at Jacksonville Jaguars home games, while the New York Mets and other clubs have implemented facial recognition for stadium admission management.</p>
<p>Trueface has increased the accuracy, speed, and architecture of their facial recognition SDK, while TendedBar raised $5 million in a Series A fundraising round at the start of 2022.</p>
