<p>In an interview with The Hindu, the Director-General of the Railway Police Force (RPF), Sanjay Chander, stated that the Indian Railways intend to deploy <a href="https://www.palizafzar.com/en/articles/facial-recognition-attendance-machin/" title="facial recognition technology" target="_blank"><u>facial recognition technology</u></a> in 200 train stations as part of their efforts to increase security. Being a global producer of facial recognition systems, NtechLab is well-positioned to provide the technology.</p>
<p>As part of a pilot program, Bengaluru train stations were outfitted with <a href="https://www.palizafzar.com/en/articles/face-detection/" title="facial recognition" target="_blank"><u>facial recognition</u></a> cameras and related software technology to test its efficacy. Even when a veil or mask is worn, facial recognition systems are reliable, according to Chander. If there is a photo matching their wanted list, the technology can detect any visual features and alert the RPF.</p>
<p>NtechLab has provided the biometric algorithm.</p>
<p>Using masked decoys to test the system, they were able to obtain matches in 96 percent of instances. Presently, CCTVs are placed in 861 railroad stations, and 5,668 trains are equipped with CCTV cameras. However, Chander notes that these must be improved to obtain high-quality feed.</p>
<p>While the RPF operates the pilot trial in Bengaluru, it does not have a separate budget for capital expenditures to fund the initiative. The Nirbhaya Fund proposal has been forwarded to the Ministry of Women and Child Development for approval.</p>
<p>According to Chander, there is an urgent need for the railroads to bolster their infrastructure security given the RPF's personnel deficit.</p>
<p>"Of the 74,719 sanctioned positions, up to 65,862 are filled, while the remaining 8,857 are unfilled. We lose between 1,700 and 1,800 employees annually, and our recruitment cycles are irregular," he stated.</p>
<p>The RPF also prioritizes addressing concerns related to narcotics and child trafficking. 559 victims of human trafficking were rescued in 2022, including 430 minor boys, 85 girls, 18 adult men, and 26 women. Moreover, 193 traffickers were apprehended in relation to these instances.</p>
<p>Chander remarked that the RPF is knowledgeable of the source states of child trafficking, including Bengal, Odisha, and Jharkhand. In addition, in 2022, narcotics worth 800 million, or approximately $9.65 million, were seized on the rail line.</p>
<p>"What is being confiscated is really the tip of the iceberg, as drug traffickers use the railroads as a profitable avenue for their activities," he said. Moreover, unscrupulous contract employees have been implicated in incidents like these.</p>
<p>"During surprise checks, we discovered contraband concealed in various pockets of coaches and restrooms; this cannot occur without the assistance of personnel," Chander stated.</p>
