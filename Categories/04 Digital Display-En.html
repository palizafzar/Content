<h2><strong>Graphical LED Displays</strong></h2>

<p>A graphical LED display, a term used for large panels, is installed alongside roads, highways, parks, sports, and broadcast full-color videos. <u></u> are built by placing blocks made in smaller sizes, comprising another LED module object.</p>

<p>LED modules are blocks of square or rectangular shapes made by putting together some of their cabinets. In <strong>graphical LED displays</strong>, three LEDs with red, green, and blue colors are used to produce other colors. Therefore, each pixel on a graphical LED display contains three or four LEDs with original colors.</p>

<p>Graphical LED displays are divided into outdoor and indoor categories. Entirely waterproof outdoor LED displays are usually used in open areas such as roads, highways, airports, and parks. However, indoor LED displays are not waterproof, and most of them are commonly used in closed spaces, especially conference halls, theaters, and airports.</p>

<h2 class="mar-top-40"><strong>Linear LED Displays</strong></h2>

<p>A <strong>linear LED display</strong> is a digital display for visualizing information with various applications in shops, mall centers, and banks.</p>

<p>Today, the use of <strong>linear LED displays</strong> as message boards are widespread. The most important benefits of using the LED display are the variety in design and dimensions, money-saving, ability to design any shape and text, quickly change display content, low power consumption, appropriate display day and night, wide viewing angle, anti-shock, waterproof, and long life.</p>

<p>The color of LED displays can include three main categories:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Monochrome:</strong> It is the most affordable kind of LED display that can display only one color.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-Color:</strong> It contains three colors or seven colors. This type is more expensive than monochrome LED displays, and they can display content with multiple colors.</li>
<li><strong>Full Color:</strong> Full color LED displays, also known as the graphical LED display, are used for advertising in giant size.</li>
