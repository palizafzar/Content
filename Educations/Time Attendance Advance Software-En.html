        <!-- Definitions -->
        In industrial societies, in order to increase productivity, we have to strictly control all the items involved
        in the executive system of the company, organization or factories. One of the most important parameters in the
        production and services of companies is the high cost of salaries and time spent by personnel. To accurately
        control this parameter and manage planning, we need various tools. The best way to achieve this goal is to
        mechanize different parts of the company.

        There are several ways to control personnel traffic:

        Manually record traffic
        Traffic registration with mechanical devices
        Registration of traffic with computer devices by card
        Registration of traffic with computer devices with fingerprint registration
        Registration of traffic with computer devices by recording the cornea of ​​the eye
        Traffic recording with face scanners
        The best way to accurately control traffic is through a computer attendance system with software. In the
        presence and absence software, we have the ability of different settings and there is the possibility of
        different calculations for different parts of the company. Information from this system can also be transferred
        to other systems such as personnel system, payroll.

        Attendance software training

        Above the window of the Palizafzar product control studio, there are four options:

        Start: To enter the program, click on Start and select the Paliz Attendance Management option.
        Display: By selecting the navigator option, the list of software options are visible.
        Features: Not defined.
        By selecting Paliz Attendance Management , we enter the program from the start option. First enter the username
        and password, which is number one, and then press the login key.

        In this system, it is possible to define different users with different access levels. It is better to set the
        required access level before entering the different parts of the program. To do this, from the Paliz Attendance
        Management option, select User Management.
        In user management, it is possible to define new users and determine the access level for each.
        At the bottom of the recent page are two options for users and access levels.
        Attendance management training
        users:
        In this option it is possible to define a new user. The user can be restricted to a specific IP address to
        access only the defined IP. In the left window the defined access levels can be selected for the user defined.
        (Figure 5)
        access level:
        Here it is possible to define different access levels by name and code. First, enter your desired code and name,
        then from the left window, mark your desired options, and finally press the save key. (Figure 6)
        At access levels it is possible to define user access or non-access by viewing, editing, deleting, adding,
        saving, updating, re-reading, executing, displaying, creating, new, receiving from, opening, sending to,
        printing and reporting. All items used in the controllable software are accessible.
        A green tick next to each item indicates that access to it and a light green tick next to each item indicates
        that it is not accessible. By clicking on the icon, in addition, we are given access to each item, which can be
        selected or not selected by double-clicking on each item. Also, by right-clicking on the window of available
        access items, we are given the selection of items. Below, for example, in user management, two options are
        selected. Figure (7)
        Attendance software access items

        Use attendance software under Windows
        When you first log in to the app, the initial configuration message will appear on the screen. The purpose of
        the configuration is to determine the number of digits of the card number and personnel number and the start
        date of the year. For initial configuration, go to Settings - Initial Settings.

        Comprehensive attendance software settings
        To make the best use of the software, it is necessary to first define and set the various options required in
        the program. Settings include options for basic software settings, shift definition, workgroup definition, shift
        definition, service locations, employment types definition, vacation days definition, calendar definition, leave
        and mission definition, and organizational chart. We describe each of them below.

        Attendance software settings
        Basic settings:
        Login / Exit Card Length: The number of card number digits can be determined up to 10 digits. Card number length
        in serial systems (PX (PTR72 - PF200 - PF9000 is four digits) (this parameter must be specified)
        Personnel number length: The number of personnel number digits can be determined up to 16 digits. (Determination
        of this parameter is mandatory)
        Start date of the year: The start date of the system is determined by this option. In other words, information
        calculations will be performed from this date onwards and previous dates will not be seen. (Determination of
        this parameter is mandatory)
        Shifts in workgroups to check for overlap: Sometimes it is necessary to use more than one shift in a workgroup.
        For example, three days in the morning, three days in the evening, and the next three days at night, in which
        case the defined shifts may intersect by being side by side. This option is selected to know the intersection of
        shifts used with each other in the workgroup.

        Online: This option is used to connect the software to the time and attendance device and process traffic
        information automatically. The information of the attendance device is transferred by the service software to
        the database of the data center software, and the attendance software under Windows removes this information
        from the data center. Figure (10)

        Setting up a connection to the data center: Here we enter the name and address of the data center database to
        retrieve the Cartesian information.
        Enter traffic online: If we want the traffic registered in the attendance device to be automatically transferred
        to the software, we select this option.
        Online processing: By selecting this option, the received traffic information can be automatically processed
        online by the attendance device (this information is received from the data center). And there is no need for
        the user to process the information.
        Inspection Periods for Recovery: By setting the disobedience time in seconds, the system visits the data center
        at the specified times and collects the latest unreceived information.
        Selected Approval Values: Some companies or organizations require parameters other than attendance system
        computations . (Such as adding a confirmation card or ...) This option is used to define these parameters. The
        material of these parameters can be text, number or date. It is possible to define four approved values. Figure

        Shift definition:
        Each staff movement pattern is called a shift, or in other words, each shift represents the duty hours of a
        person working in a working day. Each shift can be divided into two shifts, for example, the beginning of the
        first shift of the staff at 8 o'clock, the end of the first shift 13 and the beginning of the second shift 16
        and the end of the second shift 19. In defining the start shift of karting and its range, as well as the
        beginning and end of the first turn of karting must be defined. Figure (12)

        Define shifts in attendance software
        Shift work :
        Shift work: For each shift, we define a specific name that represents the pattern of that shift. Proper naming
        prevents mistakes in using shifts.
        Description: To prevent misuse of shifts for use in workgroups, the description indicates the shift pattern.
        Type of day: Each shift can be considered as a working day or a non-working day (shift closure). So be careful
        in choosing this option. Working day is considered as shift work day and non-working day is considered as shift
        rest day.

        Work shifts in attendance
        Cartesian hours range:
        There is a range for karting and within this range the beginning and end of karting can be defined. Traffic from
        the beginning of the carting range to the beginning of the first shift and also from the end of the shift to the
        end of the carting range is considered if you have an overtime license.

        Start of authorized karting time: Carting is allowed from this hour onwards and traffic before this hour is not
        seen in this shift.
        Length of Cartesian period: As mentioned, we have to set a limit for Cartesian. In this option, we define the
        amount of time that karting permission is allowed. In other words, as long as the time set for this option is
        allowed after the start time of carting, carting is allowed and carting will not be part of this shift after
        this time period. For example, if the allowed start time of carting is 6 am and the range is 18 hours, the
        personnel of this shift are allowed to start carting from 6 am to 6 pm after 6 pm, ie 24 hours.
        Cartesian time range in absenteeism software
        Shift start and end:
        Start time of the first shift: Personnel work starts from the time defined in this option and the delay in
        carting after this time will be considered as work deduction and arrival delay. And karting after the authorized
        start time of karting until the start time of the first turn, if you have a license, will be considered as the
        first overtime of the time.
        End time of the first shift: The hour and minute defined in this option show the end time of the staff in the
        first shift, and carting after this time to the end of the carting range, if you have a license, can be
        considered overtime. If the shift is in two shifts, attendance between the first and second shifts is considered
        overtime. Cartesianship is considered before the end of the work haste and deduction.
        Start time of the second shift: In some companies, daily work is divided into two parts and they take a break
        between these two parts. This method is called two-shift shift. The time and minute defined in this option is
        the start time of the second activity. This is the time of forced start of work in the second shift and after
        that carting can be considered as work deduction.
        End time of the second shift: This is the time of completion of the work in the second shift. And for karting
        before this hour, there is a rush to leave and deduct work.
        Attendance shift software shifts

        Meal range:
        By defining in the parameters of the working group, the presence in the food eating area can be considered as a
        presence or not.

        Leave is not considered in this range.
        An hourly mission will be considered in this area.
        Cartesianism is seen in this area but is not considered as overtime.
        If the food intake area is not considered as a part of presence, karting in this area or not karting in this
        area will not make any difference in the calculations.
        If this area is considered part of the presence, leaving the company at this time must be done by carte blanche.
        Meal start time: Define the start time of the break between shifts
        Meal end time: Define the end time of the break between shifts
        Meal hours in the attendance software
        Night work range:
        If all or part of a night shift is located to consider the difficulty of working at night, the night shift can
        be separated and included in the report as a night shift. You can also set the coefficient for it.

        Start of night time: Define the start of the night time range
        End of working hours: Define the end of the working hours
        Night work range in attendance software
        Floating settings:
        In some companies, the delay in entering the set amount can be compensated by overtime at the end of the shift.
        This state is called buoyancy. In other words, floating in the shift means changing the arrival and departure
        times according to the time defined in this option. (For example, if the beginning of the first shift is at 8
        o'clock and the end is at 17 o'clock and one hour of swimming is defined, personnel can come in at 9 o'clock and
        leave at 18 o'clock, or vice versa at 7 o'clock and at 16 o'clock).

        Floating range length: The amount of time that can be used to float.
        Always apply the buoyancy range: By selecting or not selecting this option, we will have two types of buoyancy
        calculations:
        Option: If the person has a delay in arrival beyond the defined buoyancy time and has more overtime at the end
        of the shift, his delay will be calculated after the buoyancy hour. And the equivalence of deduction with
        overtime is only equal to the buoyancy time. Was)
        Non-selection: If the person has a delay in arrival beyond the defined buoyancy time, the amount of his delay
        will be calculated from the beginning of the turn. In other words, because this law is not observed, the labor
        deficit will not be adjusted by overtime. (Example: start at 8 o'clock, turn end at 17 o'clock and float for one
        hour and the person enters at 9.30 o'clock, the delay of this person in this case will be one hour and 30
        minutes)
        Buoyancy settings in attendance software
        Shift parameters:
        It is possible to define a number of parameters for each shift. These parameters include shift work,
        specification of minimum and maximum overtime in shifts, negligible deduction, conversion of excessive deduction
        to absenteeism, equivalent to one hour of daily leave, determination of forced overtime, determination of
        unauthorized departure time and increase in staff attendance. Be. At the bottom of each of these parameters are
        described. Figure (13)

        Shift parameters in the attendance software
        Clock conversion:
        Sometimes it is necessary to change the registered cart clock to another clock. With this action, all the
        converted traffic in the system will be visible and the main traffic will not be displayed. For example, if we
        want to ignore the arrival of personnel 15 minutes early and the time converted in the system can be viewed and
        reported, assuming the first start at 8 o'clock, we write from 7:45 to 08:00 to 08:00 Become. This conversion
        means that if the card is placed between 7:45 and 08:00, his card will be registered at 8 o'clock.

        We have four conversions in the shift parameters. This conversion can be defined per cartel hour.

        Convert hours in comprehensive attendance software
        Overtime range:
        Minimum overtime: Minimum overtime can be set. That is, overtime should not be less than this acceptable number.
        Maximum overtime: The limit can be set for overtime. That is, overtime should not be accepted above this
        ceiling.
        Minimum overtime: The minimum amount can be set for overtime at the end of the shift. That is, overtime less
        than this number is not acceptable.
        Maximum late overtime: The ceiling can be set for overtime at the end of the shift. That is, overtime above this
        ceiling is not accepted.
        Overtime in attendance software
        Hypothyroidism :
        Omission of work deduction: If it is necessary to ignore the personnel deduction to the specified amount during
        a shift, we define the desired value in this option. This deduction is during the shift. There is no limit to
        the beginning or end of the shift. This means that if this option is defined for 15 minutes and the deduction
        during the shift is equal to one hour, this person will be assigned a 45 minute deduction in this shift.
        Convert work deduction to absence: If the person's deduction is greater than the amount specified in this
        option, this shift will be considered absence for him. For example, if the length of the shift is 8 hours and
        the person has a deduction of 5 hours, this day can be considered as an absence for him.
        Lack of attendance software
        Equivalent to hourly daily leave for shift:
        Hourly equivalent of daily leave for this shift: The defined value of this option indicates how many hours of
        hourly leave are meant for one day of daily leave.

        Daily leave attendance software
        Forced overtime:
        Sometimes it is necessary for staff to be present in the workplace for more than the defined shift in order to
        do the company's work. For this purpose, this overtime can be defined as mandatory. With the presence of
        personnel, overtime is recorded at this defined time, otherwise the deduction is recorded at the specified time.
        Compulsory overtime can be considered in two ways

        In the first case, we determine the beginning and end of the mandatory overtime time, and the staff must be
        present at the specified time.
        In the second case, the amount of overtime is mandatory and personnel do not have to be overtime at certain
        times. By selecting the second option, the first option will be disabled from the clock to the clock.
        Mandatory overtime of attendance software
        Unauthorized exit:
        Staff departure time is very important for companies, so to control certain hours of the shift to not leave
        staff can be planned and considered fines. For this purpose, enter the desired time from which the personnel
        should not leave the company and determine the amount of the deduction penalty. For example, if a person leaves
        work at 10 to 12 o'clock, 4 hours will be deducted from his presence.

        Unauthorized withdrawal of attendance software
        Increase attendance hours:
        For each shift, a quantity can be added to the presence of staff. This value is in hours and minutes.

        Definition of working group:
        Every company or organization has different sections and the way these sections travel may be different from
        each other and each follow a specific traffic pattern. The classification of personnel based on the same traffic
        hours is called a working group. Such as production in the morning or evening or night, financial unit,
        recruitment unit, guard, etc. For each working group, we have different parameters for more and more accurate
        settings. Figure (14)Working group in attendance software
        workgroup :
        We use workgroups to assign work patterns to staff. Each working group may include one or more shifts. In a
        group, various parameters are important, which we will describe below. To better understand the working group,
        pay attention to this example: Suppose the staff of the company's administrative department is working from
        Saturday to Wednesday from 8 to 16 and on Thursdays from 8 to 12 and is closed on Fridays, the working group of
        this group of personnel has a period Repeatable for 7 days. This means that they will be at work next week,
        similar to this week, and the same rule will continue forever. By specifying the repetition period of assigning
        the shift to the group, at the bottom of the window, the date, day and name of the shift to the specified number
        of repetitions can be seen.

        Workgroup Name: Choose the appropriate name for each workgroup for future use. For example, administrative
        affairs, day production, night production, one guard or two guards, etc.
        Description of the working group: In order to explain the working group, besides the name of the group, its
        description can also be included. This option is not mandatory.
        Start date: This option specifies the start date for this group. Personnel traffic will not be calculated before
        this date. Therefore, be careful in recording this date correctly.
        Repetition period of assigning shifts to groups: Usually, staff work shifts are repeated periodically. For
        example, office shifts are usually repeated on a weekly basis. That is, the repetition period is equal to 7.
        Selecting a work calendar: For each working group, a specific calendar can be assigned from among the defined
        calendars (official calendar, organizational calendar, etc.)
        Working group parameters:
        Parameters can be defined for each working group. These parameters include different coefficients in overtime,
        deduction, work stoppage, etc., and also include different decisions in different situations. It is possible to
        define two different groups with different coefficients for a group of personnel who have the same traffic, for
        example, one group has an overtime factor of 2 and the other group has a coefficient of 1.4.

        Attendance software workgroup parameters
        Basic computational parameters of the working group:
        The coefficients of this section can be numerically between zero and 9.99 as input.
        Parameters for calculating work leave:
        Here, the type and method of calculating the holiday and the limits and coefficients used for the holiday and
        overtime can be planned.

        Parameters of work attendance software attendance
        Type of work holiday calculation: Work holiday can be calculated in two modes, daily or hourly. If selected
        daily, overtime will be disabled.
        Calculation of work holiday: Work holiday can be calculated in two modes, daily or hourly. If selected daily,
        overtime will be disabled.
        Calculation of holiday overtime: Holidays also have shifts like working days, so the presence of more than the
        length of the shift can be considered as holiday overtime. There are three conditions for this overtime:

        Eliminate amounts below the minimum: Work holidays less than the amount specified in the Minimum Overtime
        Minimum Option option cannot be calculated.
        Values ​​less than the minimum should be transferred to overtime: closed overtime is registered as overtime and
        closed overtime is not considered.
        Move to a work holiday: The amount of work outside the holiday shift is considered a work holiday.
        Closing restrictions:
        Work holiday coefficient: You can consider a coefficient for attending a holiday.
        Work overtime coefficient: For overtime on a holiday, a coefficient can be considered.
        Minimum work holiday: A value can be defined as the minimum for attending a holiday, and if the work holiday is
        less than that amount, another decision can be made to attend.
        Maximum work holiday: To attend the holiday, a value can be defined as the maximum, and if the work holiday
        exceeds that amount, another decision can be made to attend.
        Minimum overtime holiday: For overtime on a holiday, a value can be defined as a minimum, and if the attendance
        is less than that amount, another decision to attend can be made.
        Maximum holiday overtime: For overtime on a holiday, a value can be defined as the maximum so that overtime does
        not exceed this amount.
        Error or incomplete traffic will be ignored on the holiday: Personnel traffic may be incomplete, ie there is no
        entry and exit, and vice versa, and also there may be an error in recording traffic (for example, one mission
        and one leave at a time And the other is registered through the attendance device). By selecting this option,
        these errors and incomplete traffic can be ignored.
        Friday Computational Parameters:
        Friday Computational Parameters: Here, the method of calculating Friday work and the limits and coefficients
        used for Friday work and overtime Friday can be programmed. If you assign a non-working shift to Friday,
        attending this day is considered as working Friday and the following parameters affect it. Figure (18)

        Friday computational parameters in attendance software
        Calculation of working Friday: If working Friday is less than the minimum defined value, we can make two
        decisions.

        Remove values ​​below the minimum: Working Friday cannot be calculated less than the value specified in the
        Minimum Working Friday option.
        Values ​​less than the minimum should be transferred to overtime: Working Friday is registered as overtime and
        working Friday is not considered.
        Calculation of overtime on Fridays: Fridays, like working days, have shifts, so attending more than the length
        of the shift can be considered a closed overtime. There are two conditions for this overtime:

        Eliminate values ​​less than the minimum: Working Friday can not be calculated less than the value specified in
        the option.
        Amounts less than the minimum should be transferred to overtime: Friday overtime is registered as overtime and
        Friday overtime is not considered.
        Overtime coefficient Friday work: You can define a coefficient in this section.
        Working Friday coefficient: Attendance on Friday can be considered with a coefficient.
        Minimum working Friday: For attending on Friday, time can be considered as the minimum attendance and attendance
        less than this amount can be calculated according to the set conditions.
        Maximum working Friday: For attending on Friday, time can be considered as the maximum attendance and attendance
        can not be calculated more than this amount.
        Minimum overtime on Friday: Overtime on Friday can have minimum conditions and if the overtime is less than this
        amount, the calculations can be done according to the set conditions.
        Maximum Friday overtime: To prevent unnecessary overtime, an overtime ceiling can be set. And do not overdo it
        in the calculations.
        Computational parameters Thursday:
        The settings of this section are the same as the computational parameters of Friday.
        Computational parameters of non-working day:
        The settings of this section are the same as the computational parameters of Friday. It is possible to choose a
        non-working day as a working holiday. If we want the non-working day to be calculated as a work holiday (check),
        the non-working day function is considered a work holiday and the computational parameters of the work holiday
        are considered.
        Computational parameters of night work:
        Night work is divided into two modes, inside and outside the shift.

        Out-of-shift night work: If part of the night work or all of it is out of shift (outside the range of the first
        and second shift defined in the shift), we have two types of adjustments.
        Only work nights are calculated.
        Night work and overtime are calculated.
        Shift night work: If the night work defined in the shift is inside the shift, here we can decide to calculate
        the night work or not.

        Do not calculate working night.
        Work night is calculated.
        Parameters for calculating attendance software
        Leave calculation parameters:
        Attendance leave software parameters
        How to calculate leave:

        Hourly: The sum of registered vacations should be calculated in terms of hours. Used for some shifts that vary
        in length of time. For example, four-hour and 12-hour shifts and ...
        Daily: The total leave is displayed in the individual report and daily and periodic by day.
        Number of shifts: If the shift length is longer than normal working time (8 hours), the person can take each day
        off based on the number of shifts. If the length of the shift is more than one day and includes two days and we
        issue two days off to the person, in reports, because the calculation of leave is based on the number of shifts,
        it shows the number one.
        How to convert daily leave to hourly:

        Shift parameters have the ability to equate daily leave to hours, and in workgroups several different shifts
        with different lengths of time may be used. Therefore, there are two ways to take daily leave:

        Fixed amount: Regardless of the length of different shifts used in this group, for one day of daily leave, the
        fixed amount defined in the option equivalent to daily to hourly leave can be considered as hourly leave.
        The amount set in the shift: Several shifts may be used in each workgroup, and each shift may have a different
        length of time.
        Equivalent to daily leave per hour:

        A fixed amount can be set as the equivalent of daily leave in hours.

        Amount of hourly leave equal to one day, daily leave:

        This parameter is the opposite of the previous parameter, ie every few hours of hourly leave, one day of daily
        leave is calculated. To explain further, let us give an example: If the duty presence of the personnel in the
        company is 8 hours from Saturday to Wednesday and 4 hours on Thursdays and Fridays are also closed, 8 hours of
        daily leave is considered for one day of leave. However, if we consider hourly leave, for every 7 hours and 20
        minutes of hourly leave, one day of daily leave is considered.

        Attending daily leave:

        If a person is on daily leave and attends work, five decisions can be made about the amount of attendance:

        Calculate according to the shift and leave should also be calculated: without considering the leave, the
        calculations of attendance, deduction and overtime, etc. should be done according to the shift, and in addition,
        daily leave should also be considered.
        Only leave should be calculated: Attendance at leave is meaningless and no calculation is made and only leave is
        recorded.
        The total overtime function should be calculated together with the leave: both the daily leave should be
        recorded and the total overtime presence should be considered.
        Leave and overtime should be calculated: Daily leave is recorded and overtime (overtime time) is considered as
        overtime and shift attendance is not calculated.
        Show error: In such a case, the system shows a computational error and no calculation is performed for this
        case.
        Calculation of leave with incomplete traffic: It is calculated without considering incomplete traffic.
        How to calculate hourly leave:

        Only calculate leave: In this case, hourly leave is only leave and is not considered part of attendance.
        Only calculate attendance: Hourly leave is considered part of attendance and will no longer be leave.
        Calculate leave and attendance: Both hourly leave and attendance are counted.
        How to calculate vacation breaks:

        There are three types of decisions you can choose from if you take a day off.

        Calculate vacation: The vacation between vacations should be considered the same vacation.
        Calculate the day off: If you take a few days off and one or more days off between them, the holiday is
        considered part of the leave.
        Calculate Friday as a holiday: Only the Fridays between holidays, the intended leave and other holidays are not
        considered part of the leave.
        Mission computational parameters:
        The mission is generally the activity of personnel in a place other than the company.

        Attendance software mission parameters
        Shift mission:

        Hourly mission is the activity of personnel on an hourly basis and this activity may take place during working
        hours or non-working hours. We have three decision modes for the hour shift mission:

        Only the mission should be calculated and not the presence component should be calculated.
        Only attendance should be calculated and not included in the mission report.
        Mission and attendance are both calculated.
        Out-of-shift mission:

        We have three decision modes for the off-shift hourly mission:

        Overtime is calculated.
        Mission and overtime to be calculated.
        Only the mission is calculated.
        Attend daily mission:

        If a person goes on a day-to-day mission after one or more hours of being at work, or has recorded an amount of
        time other than the day-to-day mission as being at work, five decisions will be available in these
        circumstances:

        If attendance is out of shift, overtime and if in shift attendance is recorded and daily mission is calculated.
        Only the mission is calculated and the presence of the person is ineffective.
        Attendance should be considered part of overtime and daily mission should be calculated.
        Only attendance outside the shift is considered overtime and is not considered inside the shift, and the daily
        mission is also calculated.
        In such cases, an error is displayed and the calculation is not performed.
        Mission calculation with incomplete traffic: Mission is calculated without considering incomplete traffic.
        Cartesian (free) hourly computational parameters:
        Sometimes it is necessary for a number of people to work in the company on an hourly basis and receive a salary
        for each hour of operation. This is called hourly carting. In hourly cartels, work deduction does not make
        sense, but over-defined function can be considered overtime. In hourly cartzing, calculations can follow their
        own rules. The following are the conditions and methods of their calculations:

        Free cartoons in attendance software
        Hourly Cartesian mission and leave:

        They have a mission and leave.
        They have no mission or leave.
        They only have leave.
        They only have a mission.
        How to calculate the mission for hourly carting:

        Only the mission is calculated.
        Mission and attendance are calculated.
        Only attendance is calculated.
        How to calculate working hours for hourly carting:

        Only work nights are calculated.
        Night work and attendance are calculated.
        How to calculate the amount of function required for hourly carting:

        Here, the type of calculation of the presence of hourly karting personnel is specified. If the presence of
        personnel exceeds the ceiling set in the next option, overtime will be considered and if there is less than the
        set ceiling, the deduction will not be considered.

        Daily: By selecting this option, if the presence of hourly karting personnel is more than the set limit per day,
        overtime will be considered for that day, and if there is less than the set limit, the deduction will not be
        calculated.
        Processing period: By selecting this option, the mandatory presence of hourly karting personnel in a processing
        period (for example, monthly) is compared with the amount specified in the option (the amount of duty required
        for hourly carting). If there is more than this amount, overtime will be recorded.
        Amount of function required for hourly carting:

        Hourly staff for each day must work in the shift at the latest rate. If you work more than this, overtime will
        be considered.

        Computational parameters of work deduction:
        Deduction is the lack of working time of each person compared to the defined duty time of work in each shift or
        processing period.

        Computational parameters of attendance software work deduction
        Daily deduction: In some companies, the deduction is adjusted by overtime or closing work or night work.
        Therefore, in dealing with different situations, there will be seven cases that can be selected according to the
        need:

        Do not adjust: The deduction is calculated and can not be adjusted with any option.
        Fully adjusted: Deduction with total overtime and if there was still a deduction, adjusted with overtime.
        Deduction should be adjusted only for work.
        Deduction can only be adjusted by total overtime.
        Deduction should be adjusted only by closing work.
        Deduction should be adjusted only with the first overtime.
        Deduction should be adjusted only by overtime.
        Computational parameters of presence and incomplete cartography:
        Computational parameters of incomplete Cartesian attendance software
        Attendance status:

        It is possible to calculate the presence of personnel in three ways:

        Hourly: Attendance is calculated in hours and minutes.
        Daily: The number of days of attendance in the processing period should be calculated.
        Number of shifts present: Sometimes the number of work shifts may be more important than the number of working
        days, such as the number of night shifts for doctors or nurses
        Incomplete cartography:

        Personnel traffic must have a beginning and an end, in other words, the number of traffic per person in the
        shift must be even. If the number of personnel traffic is individual, we consider that carte blanche to be
        incomplete. That is, he has a card when entering the company and does not have a card when leaving, or vice
        versa. It may have cartilage on day 3, 5, 7 or ... but cartilage is still incomplete. That is, for each entry
        there must be an output to perform the calculation system.

        Display error: No calculation is performed when the cartridge is incomplete and the system displays an error.
        Absenteeism should be calculated: Incomplete traffic can be considered as absenteeism.
        Calculate the whole period of the deduction shift: By selecting this option, no calculation is done and the
        total time of the deduction shift is considered.
        Deduct to a fixed amount: in case of incomplete traffic, no calculation is done and the deductible is considered
        as the specified amount.
        The last incomplete traffic after the shift should not be considered: if the number of traffic is odd, by
        selecting this parameter, by deleting the last traffic outside the shift, the number of traffic will be even and
        calculations will be performed.
        Amount of deduction from attendance in case of incomplete cartels:

        In this option, a constant value is defined to deduct the presence.

        Definition of shift work:
        The presence of personnel in companies or organizations may take place at different times and may be part of the
        time of presence at night or in the evening. For such cases, the presence of personnel will be calculated with a
        different coefficient. This state of presence is considered a work shift and will be subject to its own
        coefficients in accordance with the labor law. For example, if a number of staff members work one week in the
        morning, one week in the evening, and one week at night, the labor law provides for a 15% shift for this group.
        In this system, the desired number of shifts can be defined. Shifts are not for a specific day or shift, but for
        a specific workgroup, and staff working in this group have shifts.

        Shifts are visible in the report. In this software, only the number and type of shifts are reported and the
        attendance coefficient in the payroll software can be defined and adjusted. If some personnel work 15 days a
        month in one work group (type one shift) and the rest of the month in another (normal) work group, the report
        will include only 15 days of type one shift. To define the shift, first press the extra key and then enter the
        name of the shift, press the save key. In case of changing the name of the shift or modifying it, we will use
        the edit key and in case of canceling the definition of shift work, we will use the cancel key (Figure 25).

        Definition of place of service:
        One of the methods of classifying personnel is their place of service. Usually the personnel of a place of work
        use a working group (such as recruitment or ...) The places of service defined are used in entering personal
        information. It is possible to define the place of service with the required explanations indefinitely.

        To define the service location, first press the extra key, then define the desired service location and press
        the save key. (Figure 26)
        Define the place of service in the attendance software
        Definition of types of employment:
        To define the characteristics of personnel, the type of employment of each person is required. You can also
        adjust your report based on the type of employment. In this option, it is possible to define the types of
        employment.

        To define the type of employment, first hit the extra key, then define the desired service location and press
        the save key (Figure 27).
        Define the type of employment in the attendance software
        Definition of holidays:
        It is possible to define names for different holidays by assigning different colors. (Holidays, corporate
        holidays, etc.)

        To define the holidays, first press the extra key, then define the desired holiday name and color, and press the
        save key (Figure (2)).
        Define holidays in the attendance software
        Calendar Definition:
        Companies or organizations may sometimes use more than one calendar to staff. In this option, it is possible to
        define different calendars with different holidays and with the colors defined in the definition of holidays.
        For example, the company may be closed on Sundays.

        To add a calendar, follow these steps:

        Press the extra key and enter the name of the holiday.
        Select the desired year.
        You can define any date by selecting any date by clicking the mouse. You can also use the options to close the
        days ... to define the easier days of the week in any year.
        Finally, press the save key.
        Define calendars in attendance software
        Definition of leave / mission:
        Leave:
        Leave means leaving the workplace during the working hours of the company with the permission of the company.
        Depending on the different uses of companies, it is possible to define the types of leave in this system. It is
        also possible to define hourly leave as a type of daily leave. To define a new leave or mission, hit the extra
        key and after defining the mission or leave, press the save key.

        Define leave in attendance software
        Leave name: Enter the desired leave name.
        Is this leave a function: Personnel leave is the sum of the days of attendance and leave specified in this
        option and holidays. Absence and some leave are not considered part of attendance or function, such as unpaid
        leave. Here it is possible to choose the leave that you consider functional.
        Active: Sometimes it is necessary to activate the defined leave for a while and at another time to deactivate it
        and it is no longer applicable, such as maternity leave, educational leave, death of first-degree relatives,
        etc. By activating any type of leave, you can in the system Use it (in issuing the relevant leave and reports)
        and once it is deactivated, the above leave can no longer be used.
        Leave to be considered on holiday: If the registered leave is on holiday, leave by selecting this option will be
        calculated, otherwise leave will not be considered.
        Equivalent to leave in the attendance device: In the attendance device of PX model, four types of hourly leave
        can be defined and in the attendance device of Timax model, eight types of hourly leave can be defined. In this
        option, it is possible to assign any type of hourly leave to the daily type.
        missions :
        Mission means to carry out activities to participate in a place other than the company environment. Depending on
        the different uses of companies, it is possible to define different types of daily and hourly missions in this
        system. It is also possible to define an hourly mission as a daily mission.

        Define the mission in the attendance software
        Mission Name: Enter the name of the mission.
        Equivalent to mission per hour: There are four types of hourly missions in the PX model attendance device and
        eight types of hourly missions in the Timax model attendance device. In this option, it is possible to assign
        any type of hourly mission to the daily type.
        Chart :
        There are different departments and subdivisions in all companies, institutions and departments. Each section
        may be under the supervision of another section. This type of division is called organizational chart. To better
        understand, let's take a simple example of a company. The flowchart below shows a number of parts of a company
        as an example.

        Attendance software organizational chart
        Organizational chart of attendance software
        In the organizational chart, each manager can work in his access section, for example, view the reports of his
        subdivisions, and his subordinate manager is not able to view the personnel reports of other departments. For
        example, the finance department views the reports of accounting personnel but cannot view the reports of the
        training department.

        As mentioned above, each organization has different departments and subsections. We call each main part the root
        and subdivision of each child. To define an organizational chart, we first define the root (management) and then
        the children (subdivisions).

        To create access levels from the User Management option, we define access levels and users and assign them to
        each section defined in the user organization chart. Also, to determine the access of each user to the personnel
        information, the desired personnel should be assigned to this user. (This means that this user will have access
        to the information of which personnel.)

        For further explanation, we assume that the head of the after-sales service unit only needs to report from his
        staff and does not work on other parts of the software, and reporting from staff outside this department is not
        possible. To define the organizational chart of this person, we perform the following operations:

        From the user management, select the access level of reporting and give it a specific name (for example,
        report).
        From user management, we define the desired user and assign the level of access to the report.
        In the organizational chart, we specify the position of this person (we define the organizational chart) and
        assign the user defined in the user management to it and also specify the available personnel.
        Activating the organizational chart: Organizations or companies have different units and departments (such as
        administration) and each unit may have several departments. By activating this option, it will be possible to
        use this category. The organizational chart is used in the separation of reports so that each official can only
        see the staff of his subgroup.
        Personal information in comprehensive attendance software
        Attendance software personal information
        Enter personal information:
        • Basic personnel information:
        personal information:
        In this option, it is possible to enter the main personnel information. Entering the information of some of
        these parameters is mandatory (such as card number, type of employment, type of carding, working group, start
        date, end date and place of service) and some others are not mandatory. Only the card number can not be edited
        after saving and the rest of the parameters can be edited if needed. Some of these parameters can be generalized
        to other personnel for ease of definition. By selecting the option to generalize the filter window with the
        choices of name, surname, personnel number, card number, date of employment, place of work and working group
        with different conditions equal, smaller, larger, etc. will be provided to us.
        Basic information of attendance software personnel
        Card number: We have defined the number of card number digits in the initial settings option (1-1-1). The card
        number in the system is unique. The card number can be edited before saving and can no longer be edited
        afterwards.
        Name: Enter the name
        Personal number: The number of characters in the personal number is the same as the card number in the initial
        settings option (1-1-2). Personnel number can be changed by editing.
        Type of employment: Choosing the type of employment is a type of category on staff. Types of hiring can be
        defined in the settings option.
        Type of cartel: The type of cartel determines how each person calculates and travels. Here are three types of
        cartoons.

        Card number: We have defined the number of card number digits in the initial settings option (1-1-1). The card
        number in the system is unique. The card number can be edited before saving and can no longer be edited
        afterwards.
        Name: Enter the name
        Personal number: The number of characters in the personal number is the same as the card number in the initial
        settings option (1-1-2). Personnel number can be changed by editing.
        Type of employment: Choosing the type of employment is a type of category on staff. Types of hiring can be
        defined in the settings option.
        Type of cartel: The type of cartel determines how each person calculates and travels. Here are three types of
        cartoons:

        Normal: In normal carding, calculations are done based on shifts and the first entry card and the second exit
        card are considered and the number of cards must be even.
        Clock: Clock function means clock function. And the staff of this group will receive a salary for each hour of
        operation. Cartesian in this case is like normal cartoons and calculations are done according to the working
        hours of the person. In case of defining the amount of duty required during a day or during the period, in the
        option of working group parameters (1-8-2-9-5), working more than the ceiling can be considered overtime. In
        hourly operation calculations, the start of the shift and the end of the shift defined in the shift are not
        considered, but the traffic between the start and the carting range must be done.
        Unlimited: Sometimes the function of the staff exceeds the shift range. This type of traffic is called
        unlimited. This type of karting is different from normal karting. We must first hit the login key (login card)
        then register our card, and also when logging out, first hit the login key and then hit our card. In this type
        of carting, if a person leaves the carting range of the shift, he automatically registers an exit for this card
        number before the end of the carting range of that day and an entry after the start of carting the next day,
        which can be seen in the report.
        Working group: Each person must travel according to the defined pattern. We assign this template to the staff by
        the working group. Therefore, be careful in choosing the staff working group.
        Start date: The start date can be defined for each person. If for a card number, it has been done in the carting
        system (the card has already been for another person and has been removed from the system), we enter the start
        date so that no calculation can be done before the desired date. Entry of this option is mandatory and should
        not be larger than the completion date.
        Termination date: We specify the end date of each person in the company so that no calculation is made after
        that date. Entry of this date is mandatory and should not be less than the start date.
        Place of service: The organizational position of each person determines his place of service, such as
        employment, production, finance, etc. This option can be used in the filter to report from a specific service
        location. This option is also required.
        Personnel licenses:
        For each person, various overtime or work permits can be issued or prevented on holidays and Thursdays and
        Fridays. These parameters can also be generalized.
        First-time overtime permit: By selecting this option, this person will be allowed to work full-time overtime
        permanently.
        Late overtime permit: By selecting this option, this person will be allowed to work overtime permanently.
        Day overtime permit: By selecting this option, this person will be allowed to work overtime in the middle of the
        day.
        Vacation work permit: By selecting this option, this person will be allowed to work on vacation.
        Work permit on Fridays: By selecting this option, this person will be allowed to work on Fridays.
        Work permit on Thursdays: By selecting this option, this person will be allowed to work on Thursdays.
        • the details:
        In this section, additional information of each person, which includes the following parameters, can be entered.
        Entry of this information is optional.

        Father's name, birth certificate number, place of birth, place of issue, gender, level of education, field of
        study, place of study, marital status, number of children, position, date of birth, contact number, address,
        national code and postal code.

        • Staff leave ceiling:
        The leave ceiling means the maximum leave that can be used by each person. A ceiling can be set for each type of
        leave defined in the system. Two types of ceilings can be defined for monthly and annual leave. It should be
        noted that all the parameters of this section are in hours and minutes. All the options in this section can be
        generalized to others. At the bottom of the window, we have the option to generalize all to generalize all the
        options set to others.

        Ceiling leave for attendance software personnel
        Leave: In this option, we select the type of leave to determine the ceiling and settings of this section.
        Capacity for usable leave per month: A limit can be set for using leave per month. This ceiling can be defined
        if the annual leave ceiling is defined. If the defined leave limit exceeds the annual limit, an error mark will
        appear next to the adjustable options.
        Monthly leave transfer limit: If the leave is not used, it can be transferred or some of it to the next month.
        In this option, we define the amount of transferable leave.
        Amount of leave transferred from the previous year: Sometimes staff do not use the annual leave in full and the
        company allows the transfer of last year's leave to this year. This option is used to determine the amount of
        leave that can be transferred from last year to this year. The value is in hours and minutes.
        Annual leave ceiling: The annual leave ceiling is the amount of leave that can be used by each person in one
        year. Be careful when entering the leave ceiling. If you use the software from the middle of the year, enter the
        remaining amount of leave until the end of the year.
        Annual leave transfer ceiling: If the annual leave is not fully used, the remaining leave can be transferred to
        the next year to the extent specified in this option.
        Is it redeemable? Several decisions can be made regarding unused leave from the previous year. This option
        allows you to repurchase leave. After confirming the redemption of the leave, it will be removed from the
        system.
        Is it allowed to take more leave than the monthly limit? Anyone can be allowed to use more than the leave limit.
        If permission to use above the ceiling is not allowed, it will appear negatively in the remaining leave report.
        Does the rest have annual leave? By selecting this option, the amount of unused leave is calculated and after
        selecting this option, unused leave can be transferred to the next year or repurchased.
        Is it transferable? Selecting this option allows the transfer of unused leave to the next year.
        Issuance of leave / mission:
        This option is used to issue leave or hourly or daily missions. For this purpose, we must first select the
        desired person, so we press the key to select personnel. For the convenience of your work, entering this section
        will automatically open the personnel search window where you can select the personnel you want. To export,
        first hit the extra key related to daily or hourly, then enter the information, then press the save key. The
        options in this section are described below.

        from date to date and we have only the date of issuance per hour.
        From hour to hour: we enter the time of vacation or mission.
        Issuance of daily leave
        Issuance of overtime license:
        Overtime permission is defined in two options of the program. First, in the personal information, overtime is
        allowed for each person in general (ie, this person is allowed to work overtime or not) and the second is in
        this option. Here is an overtime permit for certain times. That is, on a specific date or dates, the overtime
        permit will be determined to the extent specified.

        Entering this section first opens the personnel selection window where you can select the desired person or
        persons. To issue a license, first hit the extra key and then perform the definitions. Finally, press the save
        key. The message Assigning this license to all personnel will appear on the screen. If we confirm, this license
        will be assigned to all selected personnel in the list. If we edit and save the license, the message of
        assigning the license to all personnel will appear again. Confirming this option will make changes to recent
        list personnel who have had this license.

        Issuance of overtime license of Palizafzar software
        From date to date: Define the desired date range for issuing overtime permits.
        Amount of overtime: For the specified period, the allowable amount of overtime can be determined. For example,
        within the specified historical range, a person is allowed to work overtime for 12 hours. Determining this
        amount of overtime is not accepted more than this amount and is not reported.
        Maximum overtime per day: We specify the maximum overtime per day permit.
        Minimum overtime per day: We specify the minimum overtime per day permit.
        Type of overtime: A license can be issued for each type of overtime, so we choose the type. Overtime is assigned
        first time, mid-time, late time. It should be noted that giving an overtime license in the personnel information
        section will not be effective in issuing a license in this section.
        Personnel Selection: This option is used to select one or more personnel for licensing. Here, based on the
        personal information of the individual, including surname, card number, personnel number, working group, place
        of work and type of card with equal filters, unequal, greater than, less than, greater than or equal to, less

        Temporary changes in attendance software
        If there is a non-permanent change in the defined shift or group, we use two options: temporary shift change or
        temporary change of working group. We will explain the temporary change further with an example. A person works
        in an office shift from 8 am to 4 pm In a certain period of the date (holy month of Ramadan), this person's
        working hours are reduced by one hour and the departure is considered at 3 pm. For this purpose, another shift
        with new conditions is defined. And for this period we assign a temporary change of shift with a new shift.

        Another example: Suppose this person's place of work is transferred from office to production for a short period
        of time and the working hours of the production department are different. Therefore, this person's working group
        changes from office to production in the allotted time.

        Temporary change of comprehensive attendance software shift

        Adjust and round values:
        At times, attendance information, including various parameters in the system, needs to be modified or rounded to
        a number close to it. Rounding and adjusting values ​​can be seen in two ways. If these two options are selected
        in the data processing, we will see their effect in daily calculations or shifts. And if these two options are
        selected in the periodic report, the result will be visible in the periodic summary of the report. In other
        words, in the periodic report, the operation of adjusting and rounding is done on the sum of the calculations of
        each parameter, and in the processing of this operation, it is not done on the sum of the calculations, but is
        applied in the calculations every day.

        Adjust and round values ​​in the comprehensive attendance software
        Add: A value can be added to the selected parameter if it is true in the last condition.
        Subtract: A value can be deducted from the selected parameter if it is true in the last condition.
        Replace: Instead of the selected parameter, if a recent condition is true, a value can be replaced. To use the
        value adjustment, we specify the item from hour to hour, type of operation and new value.
        Rounding information of the selected computational item:
        Rounding means converting the minutes of the parameters to another number, for example, from 01 minutes to 30
        minutes, to 30 minutes or ... To adjust the rounding of calculations, select the desired item and then define
        from value to value and conversion to value. These changes can be defined on various computational items from
        zero minutes to 59 minutes and converted to another number.
        Modification information of the selected computational item:
        In adjusting the values, it is possible to convert or change the computational values ​​into three modes.
        Approved values:
        In this option, it is possible to issue unrealistic reports periodically. The numbers specified in the approval
        values ​​do not change the calculations but are only stored in the approval reports. We get help to use approval
        reports.

        We select the desired personnel and month, and by selecting the edit, we implement and save the desired changes.

        disabled by selecting personnel. In this type of report, we have a variety of individual, daily, periodic,
        approval reports, changes, missions and leave, shifts and various other reports.

        In each report, we first select the personnel and the date range.
        During the execution of each report, the question of adjusting the work deficit with overtime is asked. Which
        adjusts the sum of overtime with the deduction in the reporting period and displays the remainder.

        Types of reports in the comprehensive attendance software

        This option is used to clear the window of selected items, to output and create a new format. This can re-select
        the output format or create a new format.
        Edit output format:
        After selecting the parameters required for the payroll system, we determine the output format of the file. Here
        the formatting information lines are done.
        Separator of columns (fields): Separator character can be placed between the selected parameters.
        Line prefix: It is possible to put a prefix for each line.
        Line extensions: It is possible to put extensions for each line.
        Line Separator: This option is used to separate each line with the next line. The separating characters with the
        concept are as follows:

        A) \ r \ n: Displays the information about each person in one line and puts the information of the next person
        in the new line. \ r means return to the beginning of the line and \ n means new line

        B) \ t: The character after \ t goes forward by 8 characters

        Attendance software file format
        Selected field format:
        Each field selected for the output must have a specific format. By selecting the field template, we must define
        the following conditions.
        Selected field format of attendance software
        Field format: This option is selected if the selected parameter is a number or character. (Like a daily mission)
        Clock field format: If the selected parameter is clock and minute, this option is selected (like overtime). As
        you can see in the figure, this field is defined in terms of hours and minutes.
        Field format without prefix and suffix is ​​provided with a field length of 5 characters and a sequence of hours
        and minutes, a clock length of 3 characters and a minute length of 2 characters without a field separator. You
        can also change the order of hours and minutes.
        Date field format: If the selected parameter is the date type, this option is selected. (Like the start date of

        Extension: For each field, the extension can be defined with the desired character.
        Field length: In the payroll system, the length of each field must be specified. (For example: the length of the
        overtime parameter is considered to be 5 digits. Three digits for the hour and two digits for the minute)
        To cut: In the field, we specify the number of digits to be displayed, and here we specify the display of these
        digits from the left or right, for example, the length of the personnel number is considered a maximum of 16
        characters And the defined number is 230598765, and if we consider the number of characters that can be
        displayed along the field as 5 digits, it will show 98765 for the right cut direction and 23059 for the left
        cut.
        Export output to file:

        This option is used to save the template designed for payroll output. The name selected here does not need a
        suffix.
        Appendix: Explain the parameters used in the comprehensive attendance software
        Shift work:
        Each movement pattern of personnel is called a work shift. (That is, what time staff should enter and leave the
        workplace.)
        Non-working shift:
        For some staff working groups, one shift is considered a break. This shift is not a day shift and like shift
        work, different shift settings can be set.
        night work:
        In order to consider the difficulty of working at night, we consider the amount of time in this area as working
        night.
        Floating range:
        Floating time means that the amount of time personnel are present is more important than their travel time, and
        personnel can arrive at work later or earlier than the time allowed, and at the same time at the end of the
        shift compensate for late or early arrival. That is, if the start time is 8 and the end time is 16, by
        specifying a floating time, personnel can enter at 9 o'clock and leave at 17 o'clock, or enter at 7 o'clock and
        leave at 15 o'clock.
        First time overtime:
        The presence of personnel before the forced start of overtime is called first time overtime.
        Mid-time overtime:
        If a shift is defined in two shifts, the presence between the two parts of the overtime shift is called
        mid-time.
        Overtime overtime:
        The presence of staff after the end of the overtime shift is called late hours.
        Closed overtime:
        Holidays, like work days, have shifts. And the presence of staff outside the shift range is called overtime.
        Forced overtime:
        Sometimes it is necessary for staff to be present outside of work shifts. For this purpose, this time can be
        defined compulsorily so that the staff is present at the designated time or outside the work shift for a
        specified amount. A fine can be imposed for non-compliance with this overtime.
        Convert work deduction to absence:
        If the personnel deduction in a shift is such that their presence is worthless for the company, the deduction
        above the defined limit can be considered as absence.
        Forgiveness of work deduction:
        Some work deductions can be waived during a shift.
        Unauthorized exit:
        If the departure of personnel is prohibited during the hours of the shift, the time of unauthorized departure
        and the penalty for non-compliance can be determined.
        Equivalent to hourly daily leave:
        One day of daily leave is equivalent to the specified amount of hourly leave. Example: If we consider every day
        of daily leave as 8 hours of hourly leave and have taken 2 days of daily leave, its hourly equivalent will be
        equal to 16 hours.
        Equivalent to daily hourly leave:
        For the amount of leave determined per hour, one day of daily leave is considered. That is, the total hourly
        leave is divided by the recently set number and the result will be the daily equivalent. Example: If the daily
        equivalent of hourly leave is 07:20 and 20 hours of hourly leave are consumed. 2 days of daily leave is
        considered.
        workgroup:
        Personnel traffic is done according to one or more work shifts and these shifts will be repeated in a period of
        several days. We use a working group to put these shifts together under one title. In other words, the working
        group consists of one or more shifts with a repetition period of a specific date.
        Work shift:
        Activities outside of office shifts such as night shifts, evening shifts, or a combination of these are slightly
        more difficult than normal work shifts. Therefore, to calculate this difficulty, we consider working outside the
        normal shift as a shift. Shifts can be selected in the workgroup parameters. The type of work shift can be seen
        in the reports.
        Closing work:
        The activity of the staff on the holiday is called work holiday.
        Working Friday:
        We call Friday a working Friday.
        Friday overtime:
        Fridays, like other days, have shifts, and extra-shift activity is part of Friday overtime.
        Working Thursday:
        We call the activity on Thursday a working Thursday.
        Overtime Thursday:
        We say overtime on Thursday.
        Non-working days:
        Some shifts can not take advantage of public holidays and must be defined as a non-working shift for the group's
        holiday time.
        Overtime of non-working day:
        The non-working day also has a shift and the activity outside the overtime shift is considered a non-working
        day.
        Eligible leave:
        Each person is allowed to rest for a certain amount of time per year and receive a salary in proportion to their
        work. The amount of this leave is specified in the labor law.
        sick leave:
        Rest of staff during illness and their absence from work with a doctor's certificate is called sick leave.
        vacation without pay:
        As the name of this option suggests, this leave is with the permission of the management and no salary is paid
        for this time. Dealing with this leave is like being absent, and the only difference with being absent is having
        permission from the management. Daily leave: Absence of staff on a full day with leave is called daily leave.
        Hourly leave:
        The hourly absence of personnel with a management license is called hourly leave.
        Hourly mission:
        We call the activity of personnel outside the workplace a mission.
        Daily mission:
        Activities of personnel outside the company at a distance of more than 50 kilometers or one night stay at the
        workplace outside the company (refer to the book of labor law.)
        Service location:
        The division of the work environment into different units and sections is called the place of service. Such as
        recruitment, services, production and ...
        type of employment:
        Recruitment of personnel can be done formally, contractually, etc. (refer to the book of labor law).
        Holiday:
        One day it is said that personnel should not be present at work.
        Work Calendar:
        The vacation of each working group can be different from the other working group. In other words, each working
        group uses its own calendar.
        card number:
        In the system, we define each person with a unique card number. The number of card number digits depends on the
        type of device used. The card number can be defined from four digits to 10 digits.
        Cartesian type:
        Cartesian is possible in three types: normal, hourly and unlimited. Selecting the type of cartel in personal
        information determines the method of software calculation.
        Normal Cartesian:
        In this case, personnel travel according to defined shifts. The first entry card and the second exit card.
        Cartesian hour:
        If the amount of attendance is significant and the carte blanche is not important at the defined time of the
        shift, we attribute the carte blanche to the staff. In this type of carting, the presence is calculated in terms
        of hours. It should be noted that in this type of cartel, the work deduction is not calculated. In the
        calculations of this type of carting, no attention is paid to the beginning and end of the carting turn and only
        the shift range is considered.
        Unlimited cartoons:
        This type of karting is used if the arrival and departure times of the personnel are not clear, ie they can not
        do karting according to the specified shift. In this type of carding, we must first hit the login key and then
        register our card, and also when logging out, first hit the login key and then hit our card. System calculations
        are performed from the entry to exit of each card.
        Start date:
        The date of commencement of employment of each person, which is defined in the personnel information, is the
        date of commencement of calculations and reporting for that person.
        Completion date:
        The end date of each person defined in the personnel information is the end date of reporting and calculations
        for him.
        Vacation ceiling:
        The allowable amount of leave is called the leave ceiling.
        Leave transfer:
        Transfer the amount of leave balance from last year to this year.
        Purchase of leave:
        The employer can purchase the rest of the leave at the end of the year in agreement with the staff.
        Vacation balance:
        The total unused leave of the staff is called the remaining leave.
        Approved values:
        The values ​​of the various parameters approved by the management are for display in the approved report.
        Personnel traffic:
        We call the registration of personnel traffic.
        Temporary shift change:
        Shifting personnel over a period of time is called a temporary shift change.
        Temporary change of working group:
        A change in the staff working group over a period of time is called a temporary change in the working group.
        Cartesian raw information:
        The information received from the Cartesian watch device is that no changes or corrections have been made to it.
        Information processing:
        Performing system calculations is called information processing.
        Presence:
        We call the presence of staff at work.
        Function:
        The number of working days that each person has at work is called a function.
        Absence:
        Absence of staff at work is called absence. In other words, absence is absence without permission.
        Condition:
        Every day work can be a mission, leave, incomplete traffic or ... All of these situations are called situations.
        Total work deduction:
        The sum of the work deduction during each shift is called the total work deduction.
        Total overtime:
        The sum of overtime during each shift is called total overtime.
        Modulation of calculations:
        A value can be added, subtracted or replaced by another value to the computational parameters.
        Rounding calculations:
        You can round up the computational parameters to other minutes.
        Incomplete traffic:
        The number of cards per person in each shift must be even. In case of cartelization, the person will be
        considered incomplete in the traffic calculations.
        the report:
        To view the results of the calculations, they can be classified according to different patterns. This category
        is called report display.
        Daily Report:

        individual and periodic report together. This report shows a maximum of 31 days.
        Traffic report:
        We use this report if we need to observe staff traffic.
        Personal report:
        The personal profile report shows each person in one line.
        Selected report:
        In this type of report, by selecting the parameters, we prepare our desired report with the desired headlines.
        Output file formation:
        This option means creating an output file for use in the payroll software system.
        File format:
        The output file for the payroll system has a special pattern in arranging the required parameters. This template
        is called a file format.
        Field format:
        Each parameter selected in the output file for the payroll system has a specific number of characters and the
