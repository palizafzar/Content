<h2 id="Definition"><strong>Definition of Tripod Turnstile Gate</strong></h2>
<p>A tripod turnstile gate consists of a three-arm barrier made of metal or plastic that can rotate in one direction. The turnstile gate is designed to allow one person at a time to pass through, preventing unauthorized access. They are typically operated by a ticketing system, an access card, or biometric identification. The turnstile arms can be configured to stop rotating in either direction, making them ideal for high-traffic areas or security-sensitive locations.</p>
<h2 id="Components"><strong>Components and Operation</strong></h2>
<div class="mar-left-30">
<h3>Barrier Arms</h3>
<p>The barrier arms are composed of metal or plastic and typically extend to deter individuals from jumping over them. The arms rotate in one direction to allow entrance and exit of one person at a time between the bars.</p>
<h3>Control System</h3>
<p>The control system can either be manually operated or can be integrated with advanced security measures. For example, some tripod turnstiles operate using magnetic card readers or biometric scanners to verify the user's identity. Others can be operated using a ticketing system.</p>
<h3>Base Plate and Housing</h3>
<p>The base plate and housing is a metal frame that houses the mechanical and control components of the tripod turnstile gate. The base plate can either be bolted to the ground or mounted on a pedestal as per the requirement.</p>
