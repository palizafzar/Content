<h2><strong>Definition of Tripod Turnstile Gate</strong></h2>
<p>A tripod turnstile gate consists of a three-arm barrier made of metal or plastic that can rotate in one direction. The turnstile gate is designed to allow one person at a time to pass through, preventing unauthorized access. They are typically operated by a ticketing system, an access card, or biometric identification. The turnstile arms can be configured to stop rotating in either direction, making them ideal for high-traffic areas or security-sensitive locations.</p>
