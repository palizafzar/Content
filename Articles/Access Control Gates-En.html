<h3>Speed Gates</h3>
<p>Speed gates are commonly used in airports, train stations, and office buildings with high pedestrian traffic. They are designed to allow quick passage while preventing tailgating or unauthorized entry.</p>

<h3>Revolving Gates</h3>
<p>Revolving gates consist of rotating barriers that allow only one person to enter or exit at a time. They are commonly used in high-security areas or areas with high traffic flow.</p>

<h3>Optical Turnstiles</h3>
