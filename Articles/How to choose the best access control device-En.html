    <ul class="list-unstyled mar-btm-30">
        <li>Is your business or residential area as secure as it should be? Do you know how to choose the best access
            control systems? If you own some areas or jobs that have &quot;location limitation&quot;, then you can use
            the Palizafzar`s access control system. Before you start shopping, it&rsquo;s important to understand
            exactly what you can expect from an access control system.</li>
        <li>If you are installing a security system in your home, you might want to control remotely things like
            automated door locking, turn on/off the air conditioning, or turn off lights. You may also want to be
            integrated your access control system with your security cameras (CCTV) so you can monitor your home from a
            smartphone while you&rsquo;re away.</li>
        <li>If you are installing an access control system for your business, you might want to keep track of which
            employees can access different areas. Think about the location of your entrances and exit, physical features
            of the building, any potential vulnerability, what are hours of your operation are, and number of people
            that will come into the building every day. Anything such as intruders, criminals, disgruntled employees,
            terrorists, natural disasters, and etc that could harm the critical operations and assets of a business is
            considered a security threat is important to understand that the best security system for a building is not
            always the most advanced system. Careful assessment of security needs and goals will help business managers
            to select a system lay the best foundation for a secure building.</li>
        <li>Not every access control system is created equally. Each one has varying levels of security and reliability.
            Your requirements may also be different depending on your current building and business needs.</li>
        <li>Below we&rsquo;ll tell you exactly what you need to know how to choose the best access control system.</li>
        <li>Consider the following factors to select the best access control device:</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><strong>Consider access control policies and access control device models:</strong></h2>

    <p class="mar-btm-30">One of the most important things to think when looking for an <strong>access control
            system</strong> is personnel control policies, device models depending on the number of personnel, and how
        to identify them with fingerprints, face, cards and know the mechanism of their operation. The implementation
        models of the access control system are very varied and it is very important to know exactly what type of access
        control you want. You can assign them permission-based on rank and position in the organization (Role-Based
        Access Control). Alternatively, you can also assign access base on specific names on a list (Discretionary
        Access Control).</p>

    <h2><strong>Know the type of hardware you need:</strong></h2>

    <ul class="mar-btm-30">
        <li>The next factor to specify is what type of access hardware you want to use e.g. fingerprint or face
            recognition access control device. What kind of lock do you want to use? Magnetic lock door or keylock
            control door. How to identify it? Verify identity with a card, password, or fingerprint.</li>
        <li>This type of hardware is one that allows some personnel to access a specific location or prevent other
            people from entrance them. Different types of accessibility features on devices can affect the level of
            security of your location and each of them has a certain advantage and superiority than other identification
            methods e.g. the fingerprint provides a much higher level of security than card identification.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><strong>Consider the level of security:</strong></h2>

    <p class="mar-btm-30">Selecting the security level of the <strong>access control device</strong> depends on your
        individual needs e.g. a large office building may have different access control needs than an automatic
        <strong>access control system</strong> in a public place. To decide what level of security you need you should
        take many factors into consideration. These factors may include the location of your business, the crime level
        in your area, and your business hours.</p>

    <h2><strong>History and Reliability of the Manufacturer:</strong></h2>

    <p class="mar-btm-30">If you want to install an <strong>access control system</strong> for your collection, you
        should carefully review the manufacturer&#39;s information and how to support and install devices before
        purchasing. By researching the company you understand how long the company has been working and how it
        generates, supports, or develops the product you are looking for. Once you have obtained enough information
        about your manufacturer company, you can get an appraisal before purchasing to find out if the purchase is right
        for you or wrong.</p>

    <h2><strong>Operating system, connectivity, and compatibility with other systems:</strong></h2>

    <p class="mar-btm-30">It is very important to consult with our experts when you are choosing a suitable access
        control device. It&#39;s better to install and implement an access control system, you&#39;ll get information
        about the compatibility and equipment needed for devices with other hardware. Some access control devices may
        not be compatible with each operating system, while others also benefit from web-based and network-based
        connectivity.</p>

    <h2><strong>What to expect from an access control device?</strong></h2>

    <p class="mar-btm-30">Implementing an access control system is a great investment so, it&#39;s important to keep in
        mind that after installing and implementing the access control system, how will access be done, and has your
        expectations solved? Before choosing an access control device for your business, make sure that the company will
        provide upgrades for its products in the future, and how will be the installation, service, and after-sales
        support? Also, keep in mind that if you decide to change systems in the future, you will need to know how it be
        easy and how much it can cost.</p>

    <h2><strong>Considering security in each of the control doors:</strong></h2>

    <p class="mar-btm-30">You need to think carefully about each controlled door because all doors or gates do not
        require the same level of security at all levels. Excessive security controls in entrance and exiting can lead
        to a reduction in the efficiency of individuals in the business exit can cause a reduction efficiency at work
        because every time someone passes through the door, he has to take a moment to validate and access to the place
        you want. So it&#39;s good to have the correct balance in each door or so, you can maintain your security and at
        the same time make sure your business performance is on the rising.</p>

    <h2><strong>Assessment and estimates the cost of purchasing and installing an access control system:</strong></h2>

    <p class="mar-btm-30">Before you want to install an access control device in your collection, you need to specify
        how much you want to spend. New security enhancements include biometric systems, CCTV cameras, and smart cards
        that biometrics devices are more expensive than smart cards. Business owners should find a system that is
        effective and affordable. System maintenance, upgrades, and training also include costs that you may don&rsquo;t
        mind. Be sure to ask questions about the amount of prepayment or long-term periodic discounts from any company
        you are considering purchasing. Even if you have a good idea about paying fees, contact the manufacturer.</p>

    <h2><strong>Considering the location and type of building:</strong></h2>

    <p class="mar-btm-30">Buildings located near transportation and cultural centers or tourist attractions are
        inherently at higher risk of crime and terrorist activity and may need extra protection. Research any history of
        threats to the building and surrounding area by contacting the police department.</p>

    <h2><strong>Life of the access control systems:</strong></h2>

    <p class="mar-btm-30">Consider the useful life of the systems and any future building needs. Security technology
        will continue to advance, coming up with better, more cost-effective methods.</p>

    <h3>You must answer these questions before you buy an access control device:</h3>

    <ol class="mar-btm-30">
        <li>
            <p class="mar-btm-10">Does the company has a professional service group or solutions to integrate two
                databases or expand it on a large scale?</p>

            <p>Integration and compatibility with other hardware in <strong>access control systems</strong> can be a
                great way to demonstrate the readiness and ability to meet future customer needs and the maker continues
                to invest in improving its system so, resulting in an overall solution for all customer needs.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="mar-btm-10">Do you want a web-based connection in your access control system?</p>

            <p>It is very important to choose a system that allows you to connect to your EAC system in order to manage
                system devices, users, and view reports from any device that has access to the Internet because give you
                the flexibility to be &ldquo;connected&rdquo; to your facility&rsquo;s security at all times from
                anywhere.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="mar-btm-10">Does your cost estimate cover a five year period?</p>

            <p>Do not look for systems that have the lowest cost. It is important to check all costs overtime to decide
                which system will give you the best investment for access control in a long time. Business costs,
                upgrade operations, maintenance, training, and other cases of having an access control system all have
                to be considered.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="mar-btm-10">What would be involved and what are facilities if you had to change systems in the
                future?</p>

            <p>Physical and environmental conditions in the future can change, although not really desirable, you may
                need to change the <strong>access control system</strong> that you use. Depending on the system you are
                using, it may be very difficult or even impossible to convert an existing system to another. Now
                it&#39;s very important to consider the control systems that are built on open architecture. This
                architecture allows you to easily migrate from one system to another with potentially fewer problems.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="mar-btm-10">What kind of operating system and versions are supported by the access control device?
            </p>

            <p>As the software is a key component of <strong>access control systems</strong>, it is very important that
                the system you choose is compatible with your company&#39;s operating systems also, you need to consider
                the database version required.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="mar-btm-10">How many areas do you want to secure?</p>

            <p>The choice of an access control system depends on the number of security areas in the business
                environment such as doors, cabinets, and shelves. Usually, most of the Palizafzar&rsquo;s access control
                devices provide security needs for business from one to several areas.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="mar-btm-10">Will upgrades be available for the system in the future?</p>

            <p>It is most important to ask manufacturer questions about how to install, setup, service, after sell
                support, and how to update devices. Your requirements are likely to be very different in the next three
                to five years, and at that time you will be able to upgrade the access control system. We&rsquo;ll
                continue to examine the technical details of each access control device of Palizafzar Co. Then you can
                choose the best access control device for your organization by comparing the features on each device.
