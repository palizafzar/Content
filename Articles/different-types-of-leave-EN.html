<h2><strong>The 8 main different types of leave</strong></h2>
In general, various sorts of leave can be categorized as voluntary, involuntary, compensated, and unpaid.

When an employee schedules an absence from work, such as to go on vacation, this is considered voluntary leave. When an employee is unable to work due to medical reasons, a death in the family, etc., they are on involuntary leave.


Some types of leave are covered by the company, while others are the responsibility of the employee.

Each nation has its own legislation that establishes minimum requirements for what forms of leave and how many days an employee is responsible for, and what the government covers.

There might be significant disparities across nations, for example regarding paid vacation time. In addition, each firm has a leave policy or specifies in each employment contract how absences from work are handled, and these regulations might vary greatly from one company to the next.
<h2><strong>1. Sick leave</strong></h2>


As the term indicates, sick leave is granted to employees who are unwell and require time to recuperate. In addition, seclusion is often necessary to prevent the spread of the disease, as the recent COVID-19 outbreak clearly shown.

In the majority of nations, sick leave management is governed by law. An company is obligated to give an employee with a specific amount of paid sick leave, and in some countries, based on the length of sick time necessary and the severity of the sickness, the government reimburses a portion of the costs.


In certain countries, employees feel embarrassed requesting sick leave. However, this may indicate a harmful corporate culture. This can have significant long-term health effects and lead to burnout or decreased productivity.

Conversely, feigning illness is a significant breach of business policy.


<h2><strong>2. Holiday leave</strong></h2>
Holiday leave is when an employee takes time off for a personal vacation, such as traveling, attending family functions, or simply resting.

Most firms have rigorous policies about the amount of paid and unpaid holiday leave an employee may take annually, as well as the timing and approval procedure. Numerous nations have laws defining the minimum amount of annual vacation time.

Particularly among younger employees, enough free time and a healthy work-life balance are essential components of the remuneration package.

Occasionally, employees are willing to accept a lesser salary in exchange for greater free time and the flexibility to work remotely.
Consequently, it is essential for each organization to adopt a transparent and equitable vacation-leave policy. The amount of (paid) vacation days is one of the most often negotiated factors in addition to income.

<h2><strong>3. Maternity and paternity leave</strong></h2>
Maternity leave is one of the most essential sorts of leave for mothers to recuperate after childbirth and care for their newborns.

There are considerable variances across nations regarding the number of weeks a woman receives for maternity leave and the government benefits she receives.


EU nations have the longest paid maternity leave (ranging from 16 to 85 weeks), whereas the United States and Australia have the shortest paid maternity leave.

We must also remember paternity leave, which allows new dads to spend time with their children and assist the mother in the early weeks. Paternity leave is often significantly shorter, ranging from 1 to 2 weeks, and is required in certain countries, while others leave the decision up to the employer.

<h2><strong>4. Public and religious holidays</strong></h2>
Each nation has its own public holidays, some of which are state-based and others religious. Some of these festivals are observed on the same day in many countries.

Examples of such holidays include:


Christmas, New Year's Day, Good Friday, Easter Monday, Labor Day, and other holidays are celebrated.
In a way, public holidays are government-provided days off.

It is essential to identify each country's holidays on the corporate calendar at the beginning of the year and organize shifts appropriately. In a time and attendance app, public and religious holidays can also be tracked.


<h2><strong>5. Bereavement leave</strong></h2>
Bereavement leave is for employees who have lost a loved one. It is time off intended for mourning, funeral arrangements, and other duties that accompany a death.

Typically, corporations grant their employees between one and three days of mourning vacation. In some nations, bereavement leave is required, while in others it is optional.
