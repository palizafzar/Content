<h2 id="Essential"><strong>Why Access Control Systems are Essential for Security</strong></h2>
<p>Access control systems are vital in securing your property and keeping your assets safe from both external and internal threats. With these systems, you can control who gets in and out of your premises, keeping track of visitors, employees, and other individuals accessing your property.</p>

    <h3 id="Traditional">Traditional Key-Based Systems</h3>
    <p>These systems use mechanical keys to allow or deny entry to a premises. While still popular, they are less secure than modern electronic systems.</p>
    <h3 id="Electronic">Electronic Systems</h3>
    <p>Electronic systems like PIN codes and swipe cards are more common nowadays. These grant access to specific individuals and can restrict access according to assigned schedules.</p>
    <h3 id="Biometric">Biometric Access Control Systems</h3>
    <p>Sensors scan biometric identifiers like fingerprints, iris patterns or faces to identify and grant access to individuals.</p>

</ol>
    <h3 id="Authentication">Authentication</h3>
    <p>The user presents a credential to be checked against preset conditions such as time, location, and level of security.</p>
    <h3 id="Authorization">Authorization</h3>
    <p>If the credentials pass the authentication test, the user is granted entry into premises according to his/ her assigned access permissions.</p>
    <h3 id="MonitoringManagement">Monitoring and Management</h3>
    <p>The system owner can monitor and manage access records, issued credentials, log activities, and updates access permissions.</p>
